    Today we will practice using one repo for multiple people
    Project must be connected to a local repo which will talk to the remote repo.
    to make local repo: initalize repository. COmmand palette under the gear button -> initlize repo
    in github, i made repo with the same name. no connection yet.
    workspace has the file. local repo has the history commits etc.
    commit this file to the local repo. (commit sents it to local repo, push to the remote)
    then in vscode hit "push" (instead of publish since we already made the remote repo) and select the correct repo

    Now we will work on cloning.
