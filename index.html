    Today we will practice using one repo for multiple people
    Project must be connected to a local repo which will talk to the remote repo.
    to make local repo: initalize repository. COmmand palette under the gear button -> initlize repo
    in github, i made repo with the same name. no connection yet.
    workspace has the file. remote repo has the history commits etc.
    commit this to the local repo.
    then in vscode hit publish branch.
    hit that to push this file from vscode to the remote repo.
